      <p id="description">You have so many great reasons to get away. Maybe it’s celebrating a major life event like a wedding (congratulations!), escaping for a well-deserved family vacation or because you’ve earned a place at the corporate retreat. The good news is Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort is the perfect solution for all the right reasons. Unlike a hotel, our 2,400 acre resort’s collection of over 1,250 vacation rentals includes studios to 4-bedroom units, condos, homes, villas, penthouses, and luxury rentals, giving you an enticing array of options. You also have four resort areas to choose from including Beachside, Bayside, Lakeside and the Village stretching from our postcard-perfect beach to tranquil Choctawhatchee Bay.</p>
